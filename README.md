# I can’t fully understand something unless I can touch it. My work features a wide textural variety, encouraging the viewer to wander and explore by feeling. My work ranges from upcycled textiles to wearable sculpture and walks the line between tactile sensation and personal discomfort. Within my art, I ask the question, “how much contact is too much?”
